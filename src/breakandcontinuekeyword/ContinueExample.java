/*

 2️⃣ Continue Keyword

Definition: The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and continue with the next iteration.
 

 ✅ Explanation:

When i == 3, continue skips printing and moves to the next iteration.

The loop continues normally after skipping.
 
 
💡 Quick Tip:

break → exits the loop completely

continue → skips current iteration, but loop continues 
 

🔥 Important Understanding (Golden Point)

With break → loop ends
With continue → loop jumps to next round

continue = skip but stay inside loop
break = come outside loop
