        // DownCasting: Parent reference → Child reference
        Car c = (Car) v;         // explicit cast (Manually did)
        c.honk();                // child method now accessible through child reference

/*

Car c = (Car) v; → DownCasting: Converts parent reference back to child type.

Now c.honk(); works because we told Java this parent object is actually a Car.
👉 explicit cast done manually by the programmer

✅ Memory Formula 🧠


Parent ref → Child object  = Upcasting done automatically by Java (implicit)
Parent ref → back to Child = DownCasting  done manually by programmer (explicit)

Why c.start() also works? Because Car inherits from Vehicle.
