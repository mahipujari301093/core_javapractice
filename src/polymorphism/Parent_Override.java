 ðŸ’¡ Key Points:

âœ… Method names and parameters must match exactly.

âœ… The @Override annotation (optional) helps catch mistakes.

âœ… JVM decides which method to call at runtime â€” this is runtime polymorphism.


ðŸ’¡ In short:

Overloading = Compile-time polymorphism â†’ Compiler decides which method to call based on parameters.

Overriding = Runtime polymorphism â†’ JVM decides which method to call based on actual object type at runtime.
