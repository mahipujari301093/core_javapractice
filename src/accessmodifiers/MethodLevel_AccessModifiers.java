ðŸ”¹ Protected Method Access in Another Package

If a method is protected and the class is in another package, it cannot be accessed using a parent class object directly.

It can only be accessed via inheritance (child class).

Inside the child class, you can call the protected method using:

this.methodName() âœ…

Or using a child class reference (childObj.methodName()) âœ…

You cannot use a parent class reference to access it outside the package.
