/*  🔹 What is Multiple Inheritance?

       Definition:

       Multiple Inheritance means a single child class inherits properties and methods from more than one parent class.

       👉 In other words:
       One child → Many parents
       
       🔸 But… Java does NOT support multiple inheritance using classes

       Why ❓
       Because it causes the diamond problem.
       
       🔹 Reason: The Diamond Problem

       Imagine:

       Both A class and B class have the same method name show()

       The child C inherits from both

       Now, if you call obj.show(), Java won’t know whether to use A’s or B’s method.
       That’s the diamond problem — ambiguity!
       
       
       
        ✅ Java’s Solution → Interfaces

         Java allows multiple inheritance only through interfaces, because:

         Interfaces only contain method declarations (no implementation)

         So there’s no ambiguity, and the child class provides its own implementation.
