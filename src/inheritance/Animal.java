/* âœ… Key Points

   The extends keyword is used for inheritance.

   The child class can reuse code from the parent class.
   
   ðŸ”¹ Definition

   Single Level Inheritance means that one class (child/subclass) inherits the properties and methods of another class (parent/superclass).

   ðŸ‘‰ In simple words:
   One parent â†’ One child.
   
   ðŸ§  So in short:

   âœ… Yes â€” the child can access both parent and grandparent properties
   because inheritance passes everything down the chain.
